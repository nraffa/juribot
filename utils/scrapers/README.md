# PDF Scrapers

In this folder you will find notebooks/scripts being used as scrapers for extracting the required data for the vector database. 

### CSJN scraper
The `PDFscraper.ipynb` notebook contains code for downloading PDF files from the CSJN precedences system and storing them directly in a Google Drive folder. Important: this was used directly in a google colab.

To use this script, you need to replace the `FOLDER_PATH` with the path to your own Google Drive folder where you want to store the PDF files.
